📊 Marketing Analytics Case Study: The Impact of Word Repetition on Brand Slogan Performance

🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes how word repetition in brand slogans influences two core marketing outcomes:

Slogan liking (attitudinal response)

Slogan memory (behavioral recall)

In addition, the analysis investigates whether processing fluency explains (mediates) these effects.
The project is based on an experimental dataset collected in a controlled consumer study and is framed as a business decision problem for brand communication strategy.

🎯 Business Problem

Marketing teams often use repetition in slogans to increase brand effectiveness.
However, repetition may create a trade-off:

Improves memorability

Potentially reduces consumer liking

This project answers:

Should brands use repetition in slogans—and if so, what do they gain and what do they risk?
🧠 Analytical Framework
Key Variables

| Role                 | Variable                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Independent Variable | Word repetition in slogans (yes / no)             |
| Mediator             | Processing fluency (continuous scale)             |
| Dependent Variables  | Slogan liking (1–7 scale), Slogan memory (binary) |
| Controls             | Age, gender, education, mother language           |



🧪 Methodology

The analysis combines experimental design with causal statistical modeling:

- Data preparation

- Missing value handling

- Long–wide reshaping

- Composite index construction

- Sample balancing to correct randomization imbalance

- Statistical techniques

- One-way ANOVA and effect size estimation

- Logistic regression for binary outcomes

📈 Key Findings
1️⃣ Effect on Slogan Liking

No significant difference in liking between slogans with and without repetition

The effect size is negligible

Processing fluency strongly predicts liking, but repetition does not increase fluency

Insight:

Repetition alone does not make slogans more appealing.

2️⃣ Effect on Slogan Memory

- Slogans with repetition are significantly more likely to be remembered

- Logistic regression and chi-square tests confirm a robust memory advantage

Insight:

Repetition is an effective tool for improving recall.

3️⃣ Mediation Results
- Processing fluency does not mediate the effect of repetition on liking or memory

- Repetition affects memory directly, not through fluency

Insight:

Memory gains from repetition occur independently of perceived ease of processing.

💡 Business Implications

Use repetition when memorability is the priority (e.g., new brand launches)

Avoid repetition as a strategy to increase liking

Creative teams should combine repetition with other fluency-enhancing elements (visual design, rhythm, structure)

Bottom line:

Repetition improves recall—but does not build brand affection.
